Upgrading and downgrading
=========================

How to Upgrade
--------------

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), uninstall all
earlier versions of Verium, then run the installer.

We recommand before any upgrade that you backup your wallet.

If you are upgrading from version 1.2 or earlier, the first time you run
1.3.1 your blockchain files will be re-indexed, which will take anywhere from
5 minutes to several hours, depending on the speed of your machine.

Downgrading warnings
--------------------

The 'chainstate' for this release is not always compatible with previous
releases, so if you run 1.3.x and then decide to switch back to a
1.2.x release you might get a blockchain validation error when starting the
old release (due to 'pruned outputs' being omitted from the index of
unspent transaction outputs).

Running the old release with the -reindex option will rebuild the chainstate
data structures and correct the problem.

Also, the first time you run a 1.2.x release on a 1.3.x wallet it will rescan
the blockchain for missing spent coins, which will take a long time (tens
of minutes on a typical machine).
